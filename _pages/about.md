I received my B.S. degree in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2006. Subsequently, I worked with Prof. Jinlong Yang on developing hybrid density functionals in HONPAS. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Physical Chemistry from USTC in 2011. From 2012 to 2018, I worked as a postdoctoral research assistant at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society, where I developed all-electron density-functional perturbation theory in FHI-aims. In November 2018, I returned to China as an associate professor at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2023, I joined USTC as a professor in the Key Laboratory of Precision and Intelligent Chemistry. My main research interests include developing physical algorithms and numerical methods for scientific calculations (quantum algorithms, artificial intelligence, first-principles methods) and accelerating these applications on high-performance computers.
