## 1. All-electron density functional perturbation theory

We have proposed a computational framework for density functional perturbation theory with all-electron, full-potential accuracy. Pioneered the development and implementation of computational methods simultaneously adaptable to molecules and solids, as well as to external perturbations such as atomic displacements and electric fields. Achieved billion-core scalable all-electron, full-potential first-principles calculations on China's exascale heterogeneous many-core supercomputers.

## 2. High performance quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry

We demonstrate a high-performance and massively parallel variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulator based on matrix product states, combined with embedding theory for solving large-scale quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry on HPC platforms. We apply this method to study the torsional barrier of ethane and the quantification of the protein–ligand interactions. Our largest simulation reaches 1000 qubits, and a performance of 216.9 PFLOP/s is achieved on a new Sunway supercomputer, which sets the state-of-the-art for quantum computing emulation for quantum chemistry.

## 2. QiankunNet: Neural network quantum state (NNQS) method for quantum chemistry

The fundamental many-electron Schrodinger equation is solved straightforwardly with QiankunNet, a neural network quantum state (NNQS) framework based on generative Transformer architecture along with a batched autoregressive sampling method tailored for this Transformer-based ansatz in quantum chemistry calculations. This approach significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of first-principles calculations compared to previous
fermionic ansatz methods. QiankunNet showcases the power of the Transformer-based language model in achieving
unprecedented efficiency in quantum chemistry calculations, opening up new avenues for chemical discovery and demonstrating the potential to solve the large-scale Schrodinger equation with modest computational cost.
